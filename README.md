# Project-Holder
My project was made to help identify tools as a way to make building projects go faster. It will make these projects easier by telling apart tools (specifically a hammer vs a wrench) when held in front of the webcam.
I trained this model using 50 images of both a hammer and a wrench, as seen in the Tools folder above. I then ran 10 epochs to train it. In my video, you can see the model working in real time.
